# Chat Bot AI

Welcome to the Chat Bot AI project! This application allows users to chat with an AI model and provide feedback throughout the conversation. Users can like/dislike responses, rate the conversation, and leave subjective feedback, making it an engaging and interactive experience.

## Live Demo

You can try the application live at [Chat Bot AI](https://chat-bot-ai-chi.vercel.app/).

## Features

- **Chat Interface**: Users can initiate and participate in conversations with the AI model.
- **Feedback Mechanism**: Users can provide feedback through:
  - Thumbs up/down buttons (visible on hover) for individual AI responses.
  - A rating out of 5 at the end of the conversation (using a Likert scale or star system).
  - Subjective feedback text input.
- **Conversation History**: Users can view and revisit past conversations along with their feedback.
- **Feedback Overview**: A dedicated view to see all feedback across conversations with sorting/filtering capabilities.
- **Light/Dark Mode**: Users can toggle between light and dark themes (bonus feature).

## Sample Data

The AI responses are mocked using a custom JSON file. The sample data includes predefined responses for specific questions. You can expand this dataset as needed.
